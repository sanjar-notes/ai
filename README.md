Understanding AI and ML, using them

<details><summary>note about data science</summary>
  
  I'm not that into AI, ML and Data Science as a fad mixture (or as a job I'll do someday).  

  But I've kept data-science as a separate node - since it's less disciplined (theoretical) 
and more about using common math + programming techniques to "make impact"

  - I want to **use** AI, ML for building stuff autonomously. To be very frank, to build systems that can directly help individuals.
  - From a learning POV, I just want to learn enough so I understand the essence and day-to-day project dynamics of a system that uses AI and ML. In other words, I can at least see/check work others are doing, and measure progress objectively.
